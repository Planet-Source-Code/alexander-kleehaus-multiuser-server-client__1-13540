## MultiUser Server/Client


</div>

### Description

This project is based on CODE_UPLOAD1185011192000.zip. I added a Class structure to the Server and added some other checks.

This upload is a Multi-User Server/Client project. The Server has also a very reduced sort of database behind. Every user can create one or more buffers which should act as a one-dimensional recordset. The buffers are being filled by a simple Selection statement.

The purpose of this work is to figure out if a simple database server could be built up in this way or if you have to do it totally different. I'm actually looking for some critics to understand why this is a good way or why not. So please give me comments.

No votes needed.
